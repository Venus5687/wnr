<h1><b>What is WNR (Windows Never Released)?</b></h1>
<br> 
WNR is a series from 2008 that includes fake Windows Startup screens with sounds.
<br> 
This series is still up today.
<br> 
Today WNR's Windows Sounds are From Horrifying to Scary to Normal to Scary to Horrifying.
<br> 
Some of today's WNRs are 1 hour long.
<br> 
This website will be updated soon!
<br> 
<h1><b>Where is this series from?</b></h1>
<br> 
I think it's from the Nermal Cat YT channel that has now been renamed.
